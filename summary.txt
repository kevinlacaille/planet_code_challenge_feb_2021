I participated in Planet Hack 2020, where I learned about NDVI and NDWI measurements and how they can be used to find regions of vegetation and water, respectively.

Where I learned about NDVI and found code on how to measure it: https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks/tree/master/jupyter-notebooks/ndvi

What I would do next:
- Mask out roads, buildings, and other infrastructure via road with either knowlege of a road database or from detection models (Crowd AI: https://www.crowdai.com/)
- In metadata.json:
    - Look into "anomalous_pixels" 
    - Compare coordinates to ensure looking at same region
